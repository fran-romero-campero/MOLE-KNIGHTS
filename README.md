# Zzz... BONA Nitens!

Welcome to BONA Nitens a web based tool for the exploration of "Transcriptomic and Metabolomic data. Specially, this web tool focuses on the study of the early response to light stress in the microalgae specie Klebsormidium nitens as a trigger for the development of different protection mechanisms at the molecular and celular level. We present an integrative analysis between these transcriptomic and metabolic data to characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in the response to high light in Klebsormidium and relate them to the mechanisms used by land plants or Embryophyta.

For more information, select from the left side navigation bar the type of exploration in which you are interested and follow the relevant intructions.In addition, a video tutorial has been provided that describes in detail the information collected in each section. The code used to generate this websites is available on Github. If you find this work interesting and useful in your research, please do not hesitate to cite us.
